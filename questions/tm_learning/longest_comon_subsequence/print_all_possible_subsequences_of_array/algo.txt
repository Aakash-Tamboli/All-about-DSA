1st: find length of array ex: 4
2nd: find sum of 3rd bit till 0th bit ex: 15 is answer So I store in k
3rd: loop starts while(15(k) is not zero)
	i=3
	j=0
     		inner loop starts while(i>=0)
			(k>>i)&i if it is on then print arr[j]
				 else skip that element.
			j++
			i--
		inner loop ends
	k--
3rd: loop ends
